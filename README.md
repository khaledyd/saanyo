Saanyo is a payment gateway for mobile transactions that allows local e-commerce startups to use the local mobile 
payment systems for their users.
It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), and Material-UI for the frontend.

The application enables local e-commerce startups to integrate their platform with the local mobile payment systems,
making it easy for their users to make transactions.
This allows them to reach a wider audience and increase their sales.

Saanyo also has a built-in wallet system for users to easily send money to one another.
This feature makes it easy for users to transfer money within the app, without having to go through 
the hassle of using a different app or service.

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing an easy and seamless experience for users. 
Material-UI is used to provide a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the application.
